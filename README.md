# Personality-Prediction
The primary objective of the Personality Prediction Project is to build a robust and interpretable personality prediction model. The model will take input from diverse sources, such as social media posts, text messages, online surveys, and other publicly available digital traces, to predict an individual's personality traits. The focus will be on the Big Five personality traits model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) due to its widespread acceptance and relevance in psychology.
